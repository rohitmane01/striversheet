When ever you have to find a subsequence or deal with a subsequence remeber
1) subsequence need not to be in contigous mannner ( contigous --> subset or subarray)
(non contigous --> subsequence)

2) Think it like an tree where we consider the every combination of the numbers.
left side to accept/add the number at index/level i and right to deny it
